# MDP Raspberry Pi

Codebase for setting up the Raspberry PI and main running logic.

## File Structure

As this repo contains the setup procedures and the main files for the Raspberry Pi, it is organised into the following folders.

- `/main` -- Contains running logic of the application. This will be where the "logic" happens at run time.
- `/setup` -- Files and other resources needed to configure the Raspberry Pi upon initialisation.
